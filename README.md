## Getting Started

* Download and open Destroyer.
* Drop your music collection onto Destroyer.
* Destroyer will recursively scan your collection and build library based on metadata.

## Directory Structure

* Destroyer works best when each album is contained in it's own directory.
* Destroyer looks for a file named `cover.jpg` in each album directory.


```
/album
/album/track-01
/album/track-02
/album/cover.jpg

/another-album
/another-album/track-01
/another-album/track-02
/another-album/cover.jpg

```

## Protips

* Type anywhere in the library view to search!
* Having clean and consistent metadata will ensure best experience.
