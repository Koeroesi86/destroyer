* Seeking (finally!)
* TouchBar support for Macbook Pro!
* An actual DMG install file for Mac (wow!)
* Removal of FFPLAY and FFMEG (this should make it easier to build for all OS!)

## Getting Started:

![start](http://destroyer.audio/static/start.gif)

* Download and open **Destroyer**.
* Drop your music collection onto **Destroyer**.
* **Destroyer** will recursively scan your collection and build library based on metadata.

**Note:** **Destroyer** is dependant on metadata â€” it can process [Vorbis](https://wiki.xiph.org/Metadata) comments as well as [ID3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3) (1.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4) tags. Please ensure your collection is properly formatted.

## On Artwork:

* **Destroyer** works best when all the tracks for an album are in one flat directory.
* **Destroyer** will look for a file named `cover.jpg` in the album's directory.

## On Search:

![search](http://destroyer.audio/static/search.gif)

* Type anywhere in the library view to filter your collection.
* `esc` will clear your filter.
